project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Legal Document Assistant 

AI-Powered Legal Document Assistant (RAG-Based)

Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Legal Document Assistant that helps users:
Retrieve relevant case laws and legal clauses

Summarize lengthy legal documents

Answer legal queries with fact-based responses

Identify risks and suggest clauses for contracts

Features
Multi-Stage Retrieval: Hybrid search using BM25 + Vector embeddings (FAISS/Pinecone)

Context-Aware Querying: Query rewriting for better retrieval accuracy

Memory-Augmented Conversations: Maintain context across multiple interactions

Fact Verification & Guardrails: Detect hallucinations and ensure accurate legal responses

Scalability: API-based architecture for integration with legal firms and businesses

Tech Stack
LLM: GPT-4-turbo, Mistral-7B, Llama 3

Vector Database: FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB

Backend: FastAPI, Flask

Frontend: Streamlit, Gradio

Retrieval Models: BM25, Cohere Rerank, LlamaIndex

Deployment: Hugging Face Spaces, AWS Lambda, Vercel

Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unBAis/AI-Powered-Legal-Document-Assistant-RAG-Based-

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

# Run the backend API
cd api
uvicorn main:app --reload

How It Works

Data Processing: Scrape legal documents, preprocess text, and generate embeddings.

Retrieval Module: Retrieve relevant legal content using hybrid search.

LLM Response Generation: Generate legal summaries and answers using GPT/Mistral models.

Verification & Guardrails: Ensure response accuracy and prevent hallucinations.

Next Steps
Implement fine-tuned domain-specific models.

Improve retrieval accuracy with better ranking mechanisms.

Deploy to a cloud service for real-world use cases.
