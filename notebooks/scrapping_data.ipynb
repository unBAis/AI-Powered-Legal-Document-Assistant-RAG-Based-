The\\ndoctrine of merger, therefore, applies to the former and not to the\\nlatter. Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate jurisdiction\\nof Supreme Court has been invoked, the order passed in appeal would\\nattract  the  doctrine  of  merger;  the  order  may  be  of  reversal,\\nmodification or merely affirmation.\\nOn an appeal having been preferred or a petition seeking leave\\nto appeal having been converted into an appeal before the Supreme\\nCourt, the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a review petition\\nis lost thereafter, as provided by sub-rule (1) of Rule (1) of Order 47\\nof the Code.\\n10\\n\\nArticle 137\\nSubject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament or any\\nrules made under Article 145, the Supreme Court shall have the power\\nto review any judgment pronounced or order made by it.\\nThe  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  “by  describing  an\\napplication as one for clarification or modification, though\\nit  is  one  for  review,  a  party  cannot  be  permitted  to\\ncircumvent  or  bypass  the  circulation  procedure  and\\nindirectly obtain a hearing in the open court. The Court has\\nfurther held that what cannot be done directly cannot be\\npermitted to be done indirectly and that an application for\\n‘clarification’,  ‘modification’  or  ‘recall’  cannot  be\\nentertained  where,  in  sum  and  substance,  the  same  is\\nclever move for review [APSRTC and Others v. Abdul\\nKareem [2007 (2) SCC 466].\\nArticle 139A(1)\\nWhere cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of\\nlaw are pending before the Supreme Court and one or more High\\nCourts or before two or more High Courts and the Supreme Court is\\nsatisfied on its own motion or an application made by the Attorney-\\nGeneral of India or by a party to any such  case that such questions are\\nsubstantial questions of general importance, the Supreme Court may\\nwithdraw the case or cases pending before the High Court or the High\\nCourts and dispose of all the cases itself:\\nProvided that the Supreme Court may after determining the said\\nquestions of law return any case so withdrawn together with a copy of\\nits judgment on such questions to the High Court from which the case\\nhas been withdrawn and the High Court shall, on receipt thereof,\\nproceed to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgment.\\n11\\n\\nArticle 139A(2)\\nThe Supreme Court may, if it deems it expedient so to do for the ends\\nof justice, transfer any case, appeal or other proceedings pending\\nbefore any High Court to any other High Court. \\nArticle 141\\nThe law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts within\\nthe territory of India. \\nArticle 142\\nThe Supreme Court may pass such decree or make such order as is\\nnecessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending\\nbefore it and it shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in\\nsuch manner as may be prescribed by or under any law made by\\nParliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such\\nmanner as the President may by order prescribe.\\nSubject to the provisions of any law made in this behalf by\\nParliament, the Supreme Court shall, as respects the whole of the\\nterritory of India, have all and every power to make any order for the\\npurpose of securing the attendance of any person, the discovery or\\nproduction of any documents, or the investigation or punishment of\\nany contempt of itself.\\nArticle 143\\nWhere a question of law or fact, which is of public importance, has\\narisen or is likely to arise and if the President is of the view that it is\\nexpedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may\\nrefer the question to it for consideration and the Supreme Court may,\\nafter such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion\\nthereon. \\n12\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything contained in the proviso to Article\\n131, the President may refer a dispute of the kind mentioned in the\\nsaid proviso to the Supreme Court for opinion and the Supreme Court\\nshall, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its\\nopinion thereon.\\nArticle 144\\n All civil and judicial authorities in the territory of India shall act in \\naid of the Supreme Court. \\nArticle 145\\nSubject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament, the\\nSupreme Court may, from time to time, with the approval of the\\nPresident,  make  rules  for  regulating  generally  the  practice  and\\nprocedure of the Court. \\nArticle 32\\nThe Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or\\nwrits, including writs in the nature of  habeas corpus, mandamus,\\nprohibition, quo  warranto and  certiorari,  whichever  may  be\\nappropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part\\nIII of the Constitution. \\nUnder the Extra-ordinary Original Jurisdiction, a writ petition\\nin the nature of public interest litigation can be filed in the Supreme\\nCourt. \\nThe Supreme Court shall, inter alia, have powers to transfer any\\ncase relating to the State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 32 of\\nthe  Constitution.  [Anita  Kushwaha  vs.  Pushap  Sudan   (Transfer\\nPetition (C) No. 1343 of 2008)]\\n        Even after a death sentence has been confirmed and is not open\\nto review, the Supreme Court may, under Article 32 read with Article\\n21, commute the sentence of death into one of life imprisonment on\\n13\\n\\nthe ground of undue delay in execution of the death since it was\\nconfirmed.
